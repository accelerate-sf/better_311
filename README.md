# Better 311

## Problem Statement
San Francisco's 311 service is an essential point of contact for city residents, allowing them to report issues, ask questions, and access various city services. However, the current process—relying on phone calls and manual input of information—creates friction and inefficiency. A clean, user-friendly interface that allows residents to easily report concerns through pictures and brief notes would transform the 311 experience, enhancing responsiveness and engagement with city services.

### Focus areas

- UI Development: Designing an intuitive interface that enables users to easily report and visualize issues. This should include the ability to take (and potentially auto-summarize) pictures, write brief notes, and send location data. The interface should signficiantly reduce friction for submitting and seeing issues in the city.
- Integration with Existing Systems: Ensuring compatibility with current 311 infrastructure, while introducing features that make reporting and tracking easier for both citizens and city employees. This could include sending issues directly to the responsible departments, AI that calls 311 on the user's behalf, etc.

### Expected Outcomes

A modernized 311 interface that reduces friction, simplifies reporting, and enhances the user experience.
